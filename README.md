# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer With SFML

This C++ Project utilizes SFML to visualize three of the common pathfinding algorithms, A* search, Depth First Search (DFS), and Breadth First Search (BFS) on a grid. Users are able to determine the starting and goal cells, as well as set various cells to be obstacles. The visualizations highlight cells as they are visted/processed by a given algorithm, and shows the path from the start to the goal cell when a visualization has finished executing.
